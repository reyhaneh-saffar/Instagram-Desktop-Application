- __**Object-orientation**__

This project is implemented in an absolutely object-oriented approach. Since we used Java for this project,
we tried to use the full power of Java in terms of object orientation. The project is very well organized and maintainable
because every part of the program is developed within a separate package obviously-named. Each package consists of 
classes and fxml files of its own. We tried to obey the SOLID rules as much as we could in this project.

The entire project was developed under four main phases
- 1st phase: designing and building an API
- 2nd phase: implementing follow,profile,login,sign up features
- 3rd phase: implementing direct,post,comment,like features
- 4th phase: adding additional features and testing and debugging the whole project


- __**Database**__

For this project Mysql database is used for storing data on server.
\
Here is the schema:

- __**Socket Programming**__

This project consists of two different applications, a client app and a server app developed by the socket programming tools and 
concpets in Java

- __**Multi-threading**__

To handle numerous clients simultaneously on server-side multi-threading concepts are used. Clients are 
handled by being passed to a threadpool and shared methods between multiple threads are synchronized to avoid 
the race condition and data loss
