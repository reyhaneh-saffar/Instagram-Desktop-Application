- __**Object-orientation**__

this project is implemented in an absolutely object-oriented approach. since we used Java for this project,
we tried to use the full power of Java in terms of object orientation. the project is very well organized and maintainable
because every part of the program is developed within a separate package obviously-named. Each package consists of 
classes and fxml files of its own. we tried to obey the SOLID rules as much as we could in this project.

- __**Version Control tools**__

Our team work was organized and merged and developed upon Git and we made separate branches for different kind of tasks
and after implementing an specific part of the project the team members would push the changes and notifying the
maintainer of the project to merge their changes after checking their provided code.

- __**Team work**__

The entire project was developed under four main phases
- 1st phase: designing and building an API
- 2nd phase: implementing follow,profile,login,sign up features
- 3rd phase: implementing direct,post,comment,like features
- 4th phase: adding additional features and testing and debugging the whole project

Each phase very well organized and divided into separate tasks assigned to a developer and having a due date

- __**Socket Programming**__

This project consists of two different applications, a client app and a server app developed by the socket programming tools and 
concpets in Java

- __**Multi-threading**__

To handle numerous clients simultaneously on server-side multi-threading concepts are used. clients are 
handled by being passed to a threadpool and shared methods between multiple threads are synchronized to avoid 
the race condition and data loss

- __**Documentation**__

All classes and methods and packages are documented using Javadoc and used by team members during the development process
