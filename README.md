# Instagram-Desktop-application
This project involved developing a multi-client desktop application replicating Instagram, with a robust MySQL database to store user information, images, and videos on the server side. Advanced multithreading, concurrency, and socket programming were used to enable real-time interactions, including user sign-up, login, and content sharing.

## Features
### JavaFX GUI
Enabling users to sign up, login, share posts, interact with each other, like and comment posts and so on

### MySQL Database
All data including user information, posts, comments, likes, chats and other info is stored in a relational database containing several tables.

### Multi-client Architecture
The server uses a multi-threading system, enabling it to handle several clients at once.
